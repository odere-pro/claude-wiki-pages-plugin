# LLM Wiki — Search

Locate wiki pages by keyword. This is the **retrieval substrate**: it returns a
ranked candidate set, not a synthesised answer. Use it to find the right pages,
then read them (or hand them to `query`/`synthesize`) for the actual reasoning.

Unlike `query`, search does not compose an answer or guarantee citations — it
ranks pages so you know where to look.

## When to invoke

- The user wants to find or list pages by term, alias, or tag.
- An agent (`claude-wiki-pages-analyst-agent`) needs a candidate set before
  query, synthesize, or compile.

## How to run

The engine owns the ranking so results are reproducible:

```sh
bash scripts/engine.sh search "<query>" --target <vault> --json
```

### R1 candidate filters

Three optional flags prune the candidate page set **before** scoring. They compose with AND; absent flags match everything.

| Flag              | Behaviour                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| ----------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `--type <T>`      | Keep only pages whose frontmatter `type` equals `T` exactly. Validation strategy: **filter-only** — the page-type enum is single-sourced in `ontology-profile-v1` (`docs/vault-example/CLAUDE.md §Enum list`); the engine carries no copy. An unknown `T` simply returns zero hits. |
| `--folder <path>` | Keep only pages whose vault-relative file path starts with `<path>/` (path-prefix match; trailing slash normalised). Example: `--folder wiki/ai` restricts to `wiki/ai/*`.                                                                                                          |
| `--tag <tag>`     | Best-effort filter: keep only pages whose frontmatter `tags` list contains `<tag>` as an exact member. Precision only; tag-vocabulary validation is a later item (governed taxonomy).                                                                                               |

```sh
# Only concept pages mentioning "retrieval":
bash scripts/engine.sh search "retrieval" --type concept --target <vault> --json

# Pages under wiki/ai/ only:
bash scripts/engine.sh search "retrieval" --folder wiki/ai --target <vault> --json

# Pages tagged "retrieval":
bash scripts/engine.sh search "retrieval" --tag retrieval --target <vault> --json

# Combined (AND): concept pages in wiki/ai/ tagged "retrieval":
bash scripts/engine.sh search "retrieval" --type concept --folder wiki/ai --tag retrieval --target <vault> --json
```

`--json` returns:

```json
{
  "command": "search",
  "vault": "…",
  "query": "graph rag",
  "hits": [
    {
      "title": "Graph RAG",
      "wikilink": "[[Graph RAG]]",
      "file": "wiki/ai/graph-rag.md",
      "type": "concept",
      "score": 18,
      "snippet": "Graph RAG walks the knowledge graph…",
      "matched": [
        { "channel": "title-phrase", "term": "", "hits": 1, "points": 10 },
        { "channel": "title-term", "term": "graph", "hits": 1, "points": 5 },
        { "channel": "title-term", "term": "rag", "hits": 1, "points": 5 },
        { "channel": "body-term", "term": "graph", "hits": 3, "points": 3 }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

`matched` is the score breakdown: **one `MatchComponent` per scoring site**,
sorted by `points` desc → `channel` (union literal order: `title-phrase`,
`title-term`, `alias-term`, `tag-term`, `body-term`) → `term` lexicographic.
Hard invariant: `hit.score === hit.matched.reduce((s,m) => s+m.points, 0)`.
JSON-only — the human text output (`search` without `--json`) does not emit it.

`alias-term` and `graph-edge` are reserved channel names (forward-compat for
Phase 2 alias-tracking and graph-edge contributions); they are not emitted now.

Scoring is fixed and transparent: a title/alias phrase match outranks a
per-term title match, which outranks a tag match, which outranks body-frequency
hits (capped). Ties break alphabetically by title, so the ranking is stable.

If Bun is unavailable, fall back to `Grep` over `vault/wiki/**` and rank by hand
using the same priority (title/alias > tag > body).

## Output

- Report the top hits as `[[wikilink]]` so the user can open them directly.
- Every hit resolves to a real page — never invent titles.
- When the next step is a cited answer, escalate to `/claude-wiki-pages:query`.

## Tier-2 deterministic recall

When a query term has no exact match in a page, the engine expands it before
scoring using two deterministic mechanisms — no embeddings, no network, no ML.

### Synonym lexicon (`_vocabulary.md`)

Place `_vocabulary.md` at the vault root (sibling of `wiki/`, outside
wiki-scoped checks). The engine reads it at query time; humans curate it; the
engine never writes it.

```yaml
---
title: "Vault Vocabulary"
groups:
  - canonical: "automobile"
    variants: ["car", "auto", "motorcar"]
  - canonical: "machine learning"
    variants: ["ml", "machine-learning"]
---
```

A query for `"car"` will also match pages that contain `"automobile"`, `"auto"`,
or `"motorcar"`. Synonym matches score lower than exact matches
(`W_TERM_TITLE_SYNONYM=2` vs `W_TERM_TITLE=5`), so exact-match pages rank first.

The lexicon is **filename-addressed** (`_vocabulary.md`) — no `type:` frontmatter
field is required and none is added to the page-type enum.

When `_vocabulary.md` is absent, search degrades silently to exact-only behavior
(the pre-Tier-2 contract). The engine never throws on an absent lexicon.

> **Conceptual synonyms vs aliases:** the `aliases` frontmatter field records
> known alternate names for a _specific page_ (consumed page-side by `titleHay`).
> The lexicon records cross-page synonym classes consumed _query-side_. Ingest and
> curator record conceptual synonyms in `aliases`; the lexicon records vocabulary
> expansions. Do NOT copy `aliases` into the lexicon or vice versa.

### Porter stemmer

The engine applies a pure Porter 1980 stemmer to each query term. A page whose
title or body contains a morphological variant (`"running"` → stem `"run"`,
`"ponies"` → stem `"poni"`, `"caresses"` → stem `"caress"`) will be found even
if the query uses the base form. Stem matches score at `W_TERM_*_STEM=1` —
lower than synonyms.

The stemmer is a pure TypeScript function: no data files, no network, no ML
model. `stem(stem(x)) === stem(x)` (idempotent) and `stem("")===""` (total).

### Score invariant under expansion

`score === matched.reduce((s,m) => s+m.points, 0)` is preserved. Each synonym
or stem match emits exactly one `MatchComponent` per `(source query term, field)`
pair. De-duplication: if the source query term already scored a field exactly,
the synonym/stem channel is suppressed for that `(source, field)` pair.

### Channel order (including Tier-2)

```
title-phrase → title-term → alias-term → tag-term → body-term
→ synonym-term → stem-term
```

Exact channels precede Tier-2 channels so exact matches win ties.

## R3 — Agent-vs-human retrieval contract

There are two consumption paths for `search` output. Both paths read the **same
ranking** — there is one score object (R4's `score` + `matched[]`).
Neither path re-ranks: R3 documents how each path consumes the results, not a second ranker.

### Agent path (`search --json`)

The agent path is the machine-actionable contract. Agents (and the C1
budget-aware MOC descent in `query`) consume:

- `score` — the authoritative rank key; the only ordering key any consumer uses.
- `matched[]` — the full score breakdown: every channel that fired
  (`title-phrase`, `title-term`, `alias-term`, `tag-term`, `body-term`,
  `synonym-term`, `stem-term`, and the reserved `graph-edge`), with
  `{channel, term, hits, points}` per entry.
- `wikilink` — the `[[wikilink]]` form of the page title, ready to cite.

The agent path is **deterministic**: same query + same vault + same lexicon →
byte-identical `hits` array, in the same order, with the same `matched[]`
contents. This is what makes the output gate-testable and auditable.

Agents read `matched[]` as structured provenance ("why this page ranked").
`matched[]` is **JSON-only** — it is never emitted in the human text render; humans read a clean list.

### Human path (text render, no `--json`)

The human path is the readable ranked list — a clean, scannable list of
`[[wikilinks]]` with their scores:

```
 18  [[Graph RAG]]  (wiki/ai/graph-rag.md)
 13  [[Retrieval]]  (wiki/ai/retrieval.md)
```

No `matched[]` noise. Humans navigate the MOC and follow wikilinks; they do not
need the per-channel score breakdown. The text render intentionally omits it.

### One score object, one ranking

There is **one score object** (`score` + `matched[]`) emitted by the engine for
each hit. Both the agent path and the human path read the same ranking —
the agent gets the structured form, the human gets the rendered form.
Neither path re-ranks: `search` emits one ordered `hits` array; consumers take a prefix
or filter it, they never reorder it by a different key. This is the same
JSON-only discipline R4 established.

## R2 — `--graph`: deterministic link-walk (N≤2)

`search --graph` expands the keyword result set by walking the wikilink graph
from each keyword hit. The expansion is opt-in, off by default, and uses the
same deterministic engine — no vectors, no embeddings, no network.

### What it does

After keyword+Tier-2 hits are computed, the engine calls the graph-traversal
primitive (`src/core/graph.ts`) with all keyword-hit files as seeds. It walks
the `sources`, `related`, and `depends_on` predicates up to **N=2 hops**.
Pages discovered by the walk appear as additional hits (or augment existing
hits if they were already keyword matches).

### How to run

`--graph` is a boolean flag on the `search` command. Omit it for keyword-only
search (the default); add it to expand along the wikilink graph:

```sh
# Keyword + graph expansion (N≤2 over sources/related/depends_on):
bash scripts/engine.sh search "retrieval" --graph --target <vault> --json

# Composes with the R1 candidate filters (filters apply to the keyword seeds):
bash scripts/engine.sh search "retrieval" --graph --type concept --target <vault> --json
```

### Weights and channel order

Graph is the WEAKEST signal — hop-decayed, strictly below synonym/exact:

| Signal             | Weight | Channel                     |
| ------------------ | ------ | --------------------------- |
| Direct title match | 5      | `title-term`                |
| Synonym/stem match | 2–1    | `synonym-term`, `stem-term` |
| Graph hop-1        | 2      | `graph-edge`                |
| Graph hop-2        | 1      | `graph-edge`                |

Channel order (last = weakest): `title-phrase → title-term → alias-term →
tag-term → body-term → synonym-term → stem-term → graph-edge`.

### `graph-edge` match component

Every graph-discovered hit carries a `graph-edge` component in `matched[]`:

```json
{ "channel": "graph-edge", "term": "sources", "hits": 1, "points": 2 }
```

- `term` — the predicate that created the edge (e.g. `"sources"`, `"related"`, `"depends_on"`).
- `hits` — the **hop distance** (1 or 2). Note: unlike other channels where
  `hits` is an occurrence count, on a `graph-edge` row `hits` carries the hop
  distance from the seed to this page.
- `points` — the hop-decayed weight (2 for hop-1, 1 for hop-2).

The hard `score===sum(matched.points)` invariant is preserved: every `score+=`
is paired with a `matched.push()`.

### Bodyless new hits

Graph-only hits (pages discovered solely by the walk, with no keyword match)
have `snippet: ""` — the engine never reads page bodies during traversal.

### Determinism guarantee

Same vault + same query + same edges + same N → byte-identical output across
runs. BFS processes frontier pages in sorted vault-relative path order,
predicates in fixed `edges` array order, resolved targets in sorted title order.
Nearest-hop dedup: a page reached at hop-1 is never re-recorded at hop-2.

### Off-by-default guarantee

When `--graph` is absent, `search` is byte-identical to the pre-graph baseline.
Zero graph code is observable on the default path.

### Predicates walked

R2 uses the provenance/association core from `ontology-profile-v1`:
`sources`, `related`, `depends_on`. Only these three predicates are followed.
Fields outside the `GraphEdge` closed union (e.g. `tags`) are never traversed.
`contradicts`/`supersedes` walking and N>2 are deferred to Phase 3.
