# Graph Colors

Apply per-topic color groups to the Obsidian graph view using the internal
graph plugin API via `obsidian eval`, with a documented headless fallback
when the Obsidian CLI is unavailable.

## Initial graph configuration (minimum scaffold)

`vault/.obsidian/` is **not** tracked in git — the whole directory is
regenerable cache (ADR-0023). When `vault/.obsidian/graph.json` is absent (a
fresh vault, or the polish agent's Step 1.3 "create the minimum scaffold"
path), create it with these **initial filters** — the deterministic defaults
this skill writes (nothing is shipped pre-tracked; the plugin generates the
config per vault):

| Filter               | Setting | `graph.json` field        | Why                                                                                  |
| -------------------- | ------- | ------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Search               | empty   | `"search": ""`            | No pre-filter; the whole wiki is visible.                                            |
| Tags                 | off     | `"showTags": false`       | Tag nodes double every page and drown the topic structure.                           |
| Attachments          | off     | `"showAttachments": false`| `raw/assets/` binaries are provenance payload, not knowledge nodes.                  |
| Existing files only  | **on**  | `"hideUnresolved": true`  | Dangling wikilinks are lint errors, not graph nodes — the graph shows real pages.    |
| Orphans              | **on**  | `"showOrphans": true`     | Orphan pages are a curator signal; hiding them would mask exactly what needs fixing. |

`colorGroups` starts empty — per-topic colors are applied by the polish agent
(Steps below) through the apply contract. Preserve these filter values when
editing color groups; the color workflow must not flip filters.

Alongside `graph.json`, the scaffold also asserts the **wiki-only exclusions**
in `vault/.obsidian/app.json`:

```json
{ "userIgnoreFilters": ["raw/", "_templates/", "_proposed/"] }
```

This is Obsidian's "Excluded files" setting: `raw/` (provenance payload),
`_templates/` (scaffolding), and `_proposed/` (unreviewed drafts) disappear
from the graph, search, and link autocomplete — the Obsidian experience shows
only generated wiki pages. If `app.json` is absent, create it with exactly
this content. If it exists, **merge**: append any missing entry to
`userIgnoreFilters`, never remove user entries, and preserve every other key
unchanged.

## Apply contract — two tiers

Color groups are applied through exactly one of two paths, tried in order:

1. **Preferred — `obsidian eval` + `graph.saveOptions()`.** When the Obsidian
   CLI is available, mutate the live graph plugin options and persist them
   with `graph.saveOptions(graph.options)` (Workflow step 5 below). Obsidian
   writes `graph.json` itself, and open graph views can be refreshed in place.
2. **Headless fallback — write `vault/.obsidian/graph.json` directly.** When
   the Obsidian CLI is unavailable (not installed, or no running instance),
   edit `vault/.obsidian/graph.json` as a file. Modify **only** the
   `colorGroups` array and the `collapse-color-groups` key; preserve every
   other key in the file unchanged (filters, forces, display settings). If
   the file is absent, create it from the minimum scaffold above first. Then
   print exactly:

   ```
   [fallback] graph-colors: wrote .obsidian/graph.json directly (restart Obsidian to load)
   ```

The fallback is a first-class path, not a skip: a headless environment (CI,
SSH session, machine without Obsidian) still gets correct colors, and
Obsidian loads them on next start. Never report `[skip]` for CLI
unavailability.

## How it works

Obsidian's graph view supports **color groups** — search queries paired with
colors. Notes matching a query render in that color. Groups are matched
top-down (first match wins), so more specific paths must come before less
specific ones.

The API path:

```
app.internalPlugins.plugins['graph'].instance.options.colorGroups
```

Folder notes (`wiki/<topic>/<topic>.md`, `type: index`) need no group of
their own: they live inside their topic folder, so the topic's `path:` group
colors them along with the pages they index. (Legacy `_index.md` files, where
still present, are covered the same way.)

## Workflow

### 1. Discover topic folders

```bash
find vault/wiki -mindepth 1 -maxdepth 1 -type d | sort
```

Also find subtopic folders (depth 2) that warrant their own color:

```bash
find vault/wiki -mindepth 2 -maxdepth 2 -type d -not -path '*/_sources' -not -path '*/_synthesis' | sort
```

### 2. Read current color groups

```bash
obsidian eval code="JSON.stringify(app.internalPlugins.plugins['graph'].instance.options.colorGroups, null, 2)"
```

If the CLI is unavailable, read `vault/.obsidian/graph.json` directly and
take `colorGroups` from there (the fallback tier of the apply contract).

### 3. Build the color palette

Assign a unique color to each topic branch. Use this default palette for
consistency — extend it when more topics are added:

| Index | Hex     | RGB int  | Use for                            |
| ----- | ------- | -------- | ---------------------------------- |
| 0     | #3498DB | 3447003  | 1st subtopic (blue)                |
| 1     | #FFA500 | 16750848 | 2nd subtopic (orange)              |
| 2     | #A020F0 | 10494192 | 3rd subtopic (purple)              |
| 3     | #57E567 | 5763719  | parent topic (green)               |
| 4     | #E74C3C | 15158332 | 2nd top-level topic (red)          |
| 5     | #979F9F | 9936031  | sources (gray)                     |
| 6     | #FFFF00 | 16776960 | synthesis (yellow)                 |
| 7     | #1ABC9C | 1751452  | 3rd top-level topic (teal)         |
| 8     | #E91E63 | 15277667 | 4th top-level topic (pink)         |
| 9     | #FF5722 | 16734498 | 5th top-level topic (deep orange)  |
| 10    | #00BCD4 | 48340    | 6th top-level topic (cyan)         |
| 11    | #8BC34A | 9159498  | 7th top-level topic (light green)  |
| 12    | #FF9800 | 16750592 | 8th top-level topic (amber)        |
| 13    | #9C27B0 | 10233776 | 9th top-level topic (deep purple)  |
| 14    | #607D8B | 6323595  | 10th top-level topic (blue gray)   |

### 4. Build the color groups array

Rules for ordering — **topics → specials**:

- **Subtopic paths before parent paths** (e.g., `path:wiki/topic/subtopic` before `path:wiki/topic`)
- **`_sources` and `_synthesis`** after the topic groups (they are cross-cutting specials)

Every group queries a `path:wiki/...` — the graph colors only generated wiki
pages. Never add groups for `raw/`, `_templates/`, or `_proposed/`: those
paths are excluded from Obsidian's index entirely (see the wiki-only
exclusions above), so a group matching them is dead weight.

There is no index catch-all group: folder notes are topic-named files inside
their topic folder and take the topic's color via its `path:` group.

Each group is an object:

```json
{"query": "path:wiki/topic-folder", "color": {"a": 1, "rgb": <decimal>}}
```

### 5. Apply via obsidian eval

```bash
obsidian eval code="
const graph = app.internalPlugins.plugins['graph'].instance;
graph.options.colorGroups = <JSON_ARRAY>;
graph.options['collapse-color-groups'] = false;
graph.saveOptions(graph.options);
'Applied ' + graph.options.colorGroups.length + ' color groups'
"
```

If this command is unavailable, fall back to the direct `graph.json` write
per the apply contract above (only `colorGroups` and
`collapse-color-groups`; print the exact `[fallback]` line).

### 6. Refresh open graph views

```bash
obsidian eval code="
const leaves = app.workspace.getLeavesOfType('graph');
leaves.forEach(l => {
  if (l.view && l.view.dataEngine) {
    l.view.dataEngine.updateSearch();
  }
});
'Refreshed ' + leaves.length + ' graph views'
"
```

Skip this step on the fallback tier — there is no running Obsidian to
refresh; the `[fallback]` line already tells the user to restart Obsidian.

### 7. Report

Tell the user which color groups were applied and the color assignments
(and, on the fallback tier, that `graph.json` was written directly).

## Adding a single topic color

When a new top-level topic folder is created during ingest:

1. Read current color groups via `obsidian eval` (or from `graph.json` on the fallback tier)
2. Pick the next unused color from the palette
3. Insert the new group BEFORE the `_sources`/`_synthesis` special groups
4. Apply and save per the apply contract

## Removing a topic color

When a topic folder is deleted or merged:

1. Read current color groups
2. Filter out entries matching the removed path
3. Apply and save

## Regenerate from scratch — graph config is cache, not state

`.obsidian/graph.json` and the plugin-owned keys of `.obsidian/app.json`
(`userIgnoreFilters`) are **disposable cache**. Every value in them is derived
deterministically from the `wiki/` topic tree plus the palette table above —
nothing in them is precious. Dropping them is always safe; restoring them is
one skill run:

1. Delete `vault/.obsidian/graph.json` (or empty its `colorGroups` array).
2. Run this skill (or let the polish agent's Step 1 run after the next
   ingest/curator pass).
3. The minimum scaffold is recreated, one topic group per top-level
   `wiki/<topic>/` folder is rebuilt in palette order, the
   `_sources`/`_synthesis` specials are appended, and the wiki-only
   exclusions are re-asserted in `app.json`.

The same regeneration runs on both apply tiers — `obsidian eval` when
Obsidian is up, the headless `graph.json`/`app.json` file write otherwise. Two
consecutive regenerations produce byte-identical files (idempotent), so a
clobbered, hand-edited, or deleted graph config is never a problem worth
debugging: regenerate it.

## Converting hex to RGB integer

The `rgb` field is a decimal integer, not hex. To convert:

```
#RRGGBB → parseInt("RRGGBB", 16)
Example: #3498DB → parseInt("3498DB", 16) → 3447003
```

## Rules

- Always read current groups before writing — preserve user-added custom groups
- Order matters: topics → specials (`_sources`, `_synthesis`)
- Color only `wiki/` paths — `raw/`, `_templates/`, and `_proposed/` are
  excluded from Obsidian's index; never add groups for them
- One color per top-level topic; subtopics get their own color only when the
  parent has 3+ subtopic folders
- `_sources` and `_synthesis` groups are always present; there is no index
  catch-all — folder notes take their topic's color
- Apply through the two-tier contract: `obsidian eval` preferred, direct
  `graph.json` write as the documented headless fallback
- After applying, verify with a read-back (eval read, or re-read `graph.json`
  on the fallback tier)
- Treat `graph.json`/`app.json` as regenerable cache — when in doubt,
  regenerate from scratch rather than repairing by hand
