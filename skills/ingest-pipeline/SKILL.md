# Wiki Ingest Pipeline — Plan & Optimize Procedures (reference)

The Step 1.4 topic-tree plan + confirmation gate, the Step 3 optimize
(destructive restructure) procedure, and the final-report template for
`claude-wiki-pages-ingest-agent`. The agent reads this skill at the start of
Step 1.4 and Step 3, and when composing the final report. Schema authority
remains `vault/CLAUDE.md`; the contract, preflight, page-write steps, auto-heal
delegation, synthesis, model selection, and hard rules live in the agent body.
Every page the pipeline produces follows the house voice —
see [`skills/voice`](../voice/SKILL.md): a one-line plain-language definition
first, then typed content in the engineer register, no marketing inside the vault.

## Step 1.4 — Plan the topic tree (externalize, then confirm)

The topic-tree shape is the most consequential decision of the run. Errors here
cascade into every page's `parent:` and `path:`, and into the Obsidian graph
structure. Externalize the plan so the user can review or edit before any page
is written.

> **PDF sources (`source_format: pdf`):** when a source is a PDF under
> `raw/assets/`, apply the PDF ingest path documented in
> `skills/ingest/SKILL.md` — "PDF sources (I4): `source_format: pdf`" — before
> planning the topic tree. The required fields (`source_format: pdf`,
> `attachment_path`, `extracted_at`) must appear in the source note, and the
> PDF remains immutable in `raw/assets/` throughout. Classification and dedup
> proceed identically to text sources.

### 1.4a — Write the plan

Write to `vault/output/_pipeline-plan-YYYY-MM-DD.md` (git-ignored; no frontmatter required). Structure:

```
# Ingest plan — YYYY-MM-DD

## Sources in this run
- <source-1.md> — N entities, M concepts
- <source-2.md> — N entities, M concepts
...

## Entities and concepts extracted

> For each extracted item, apply the **classification checklist** in
> `skills/ingest/SKILL.md` — assign exactly one `type` (and, for entities,
> one `entity_type`) drawn from `ontology-profile-v1` in `vault/CLAUDE.md`.
> Never invent out-of-enum values; flag ambiguous cases for human review.
>
> Also apply the **two-pass alias-aware dedup** from `skills/ingest/SKILL.md`
> before marking any item as `new`. Pass 1 = exact title match; pass 2 =
> alias-aware match against existing pages' `aliases` fields. Mark items as
> `existing` if either pass matches, and plan an additive extension (never a
> duplicate). See "Dedup: two-pass existence check (I2)" in
> `skills/ingest/SKILL.md` for the full procedure.

- [<new|existing>] <Entity/Concept name> — `type: <type>` (entity: `entity_type: <value>`) — from <source(s)>
...

## Proposed topic tree

wiki/<existing-or-new-topic>/
├── <topic>.md                   [new | existing]   # folder note (legacy _index.md if already present)
├── <page>.md                    [new | update]
├── <subtopic>/                  [new | existing]
│   ├── <subtopic>.md            [new | existing]   # folder note
│   └── <page>.md                [new | update]
...

## Folder size check
- <topic>/: N direct children (target ≤ 12)
- <topic>/<subtopic>/: N direct children (target ≤ 12)

## Graph color groups needed
- <new-top-level-topic> → next palette color
- (or: none)

## Open decisions
- <any ambiguities the model resolved — e.g., "placed X under Y instead of Z because …">
```

The plan must obey `vault/CLAUDE.md` folder-hierarchy rules (max depth 4, grouped by semantic domain, every folder gets a folder note `<folder>/<folder>.md`) and ingest-specific sizing:

- **Target ≤ 12 pages per folder.** Plan subtopic folders up front if exceeded.
- Entities cluster into `roles/`, `tools/`, or named subtopic folders.
- Deliverables/build items/templates cluster into `deliverables/` or `templates/`.
- Blockers/decisions/project-tracking cluster into `blockers/` or `project/`.
- Process concepts (flows, tiers, triggers) stay in the parent topic folder.

### 1.4b — Confirmation gate

Report to the user:

```
Ingest plan written to vault/output/_pipeline-plan-YYYY-MM-DD.md.

Summary:
- N new sources, M total entities/concepts
- N new folders, N updated folders
- N pages will be created, M pages will be updated
- Graph color groups to add: N

Review the plan. Options:
  (a) Approve — proceed to write pages
  (b) Edit the plan file, then approve — I'll re-read before proceeding
  (c) Abort — no pages will be written
```

**Stop. Wait for explicit approval before continuing.** If the user edits the plan file, re-read it before 1.5. If the user aborts, log the abort to `wiki/log.md` and exit:

```
## [YYYY-MM-DD] ingest-aborted | Plan declined
Plan at vault/output/_pipeline-plan-YYYY-MM-DD.md. N sources left unprocessed.
```

## Parallel-extract fan-out and EXTRACT envelope (P1-A2, P1-A3, P1-A4)

This section documents the map-only parallel-extract design for the
`claude-wiki-pages-ingest-agent`. The ingest-agent reads this section at
Step 1.2b. All invariants below are gate-tested by
`tests/scripts/extract-worker-frontmatter.bats` and the determinism replay
gate (P1-A8).

### Typed EXTRACT envelope

An extract worker returns a fenced YAML block (`extract_envelope:`) in its
text response. The envelope carries:

- **`source_path`** — the assigned raw source path (relative to vault).
- **`items[]`** — extracted entities, concepts, topics, projects, and
  synthesis candidates, each carrying:
  - `slug_candidate` — kebab-case hint; the writer canonicalizes via the
    two-pass alias-aware dedup (I2, `skills/ingest/SKILL.md`).
  - `type` — legal value from `ontology-profile-v1` in `vault/CLAUDE.md`.
  - `entity_type` — required when `type: entity`; legal value from the same
    profile.
  - `title`, `summary`, `source_quotes[]`, `confidence`, `derived`.
  - `out_of_enum: true` + `review_reason` when no legal type fits (the
    writer routes these to `_proposed/`).
- **`predicates[]`** — typed relationships (`subject_candidate`,
  `predicate`, `object_candidate`).
- **`implied_folders[]`** — folder/index nodes implied by new topics.
- **`source_note`** — title, author, publisher, date, url, summary, key
  claims for the source summary page.
- **`error`** — empty on success; non-empty signals worker failure
  (SKIP-AND-BACKLOG).

Workers return `{slug_candidate, extracted content}` only — **never a
create/update verdict** and **never a final slug**. Create vs update and
slug canonicalization are the single writer's exclusive responsibilities.

### Closed-vocabulary enforcement

Every `type` and `entity_type` in the envelope must be a legal value drawn
from `ontology-profile-v1` in `vault/CLAUDE.md`. Workers must not invent
out-of-enum values. When an item has no legal type, workers set
`out_of_enum: true` + `review_reason`; the writer routes those items to
`_proposed/` with the reason logged, and they are never written directly to
`wiki/` with a guessed heading.

### Single-writer dedup and coalesce contract

The ingest-agent (the single writer) is the only entity that creates or
updates wiki pages. It receives N envelopes (one per source) and:

1. **Two-pass alias-aware dedup (I2).** For each `slug_candidate` in the
   envelopes, run the two-pass existence check defined in
   `skills/ingest/SKILL.md` ("Dedup: two-pass existence check"):
   - Pass 1: exact title match (case-insensitive) against existing pages.
   - Pass 2: alias match against existing pages' `aliases` fields.
   If either pass matches, this is an **update** (additive merge);
   otherwise it is a **create**.

2. **Cross-envelope coalesce.** Multiple envelopes may propose the same
   entity (different sources, different alias forms). Before deciding
   create vs update, group all envelope items by canonical title (after
   applying the string-identity resolver from PR #29). For each group:
   - **Union `sources`** — every contributing source appears in the
     final page's `sources` list.
   - **Union `related`** — all cross-references are preserved.
   - **`max()` confidence** — take the highest confidence value from
     contributing items (the reinforce rule: more sources = more
     confident).
   - **`derived: true` only if ALL contributors are derived** — if any
     contributor is non-derived, the merged page is non-derived.
   - **Stable sort by canonical title** — ensures byte-identical output
     regardless of envelope arrival order.

3. **Execute in stable canonical-title order.** Apply creates and updates
   in this fixed order. The result is byte-identical at `maxParallelExtract=1`
   vs N with shuffled worker returns because the sort is stable over the
   canonical title key, which does not depend on arrival order.

4. **Log once per source.** The single writer appends to `wiki/log.md`
   and is the only appender (ordered `wiki/log.md` invariant from TEAM-BRIEF §5).

### Byte-identical guarantee

At `maxParallelExtract=1`, no Task fan-out occurs; the agent reads and
extracts inline — output is byte-identical to the pre-feature baseline. At
`maxParallelExtract>1` with shuffled worker return order, the stable-sort
coalesce ensures the written pages and `log.md` source order are
byte-identical to the `=1` run. This is the mechanical determinism
guarantee required by D5/D8.

### SKIP-AND-BACKLOG on worker failure (OQ-5)

When an extract worker fails (missing envelope block, non-empty `error`
field, or timeout), the ingest-agent:

1. Records that source as unprocessed backlog (not as a processed source in
   `wiki/log.md`).
2. Continues applying all successfully validated envelopes.
3. The single `snapshot.sh post` at Step 1.9 covers exactly the applied
   subset — it is a single revertible unit.
4. The final report lists failed sources under "Worker failures" with the
   error reason.

This matches the existing 25-cap-then-backlog semantics: forward progress
is preserved and the snapshot range remains revertible.

## Step 3 — Optimize (opt-in, destructive)

**This step restructures folders with `git mv` and rewrites `parent:`/`path:` across many pages. It requires explicit user confirmation.**

### 3.1 Audit

Count pages per folder. Identify folders with > 12 direct `.md` children (excluding the folder's own index note). If none, skip Step 3 entirely and report "no optimization needed".

### 3.2 Plan and confirm

Write the restructure plan to `vault/output/_restructure-plan-YYYY-MM-DD.md`
(git-ignored; no frontmatter required). Structure:

```
# Restructure plan — YYYY-MM-DD

## Proposed restructure

<folder-a>/ (18 pages) → split into:
  <folder-a>/subtopic-x/  (<count> pages: <list>)
  <folder-a>/subtopic-y/  (<count> pages: <list>)

<folder-b>/ (14 pages) → split into:
  ...

## Summary
- Cross-links to add: N
- Files to move: N (git mv)
- Frontmatter rewrites: N (parent/path fields)
```

Report to the user:

```
Restructure plan written to vault/output/_restructure-plan-YYYY-MM-DD.md.

Options:
  (a) Approve — execute the restructure
  (b) Edit the plan file, then approve — I'll re-read before executing
  (c) Decline — skip Step 3, proceed to Step 4
```

**Stop. Wait for explicit approval before continuing.** If the user edits the plan file, re-read it before 3.3. If the user declines, skip to Step 4.

### 3.3 Execute

Only after explicit confirmation:

1. Create subtopic folders, each with its folder note (`<subtopic>/<subtopic>.md`).
2. Move each page into the correct subtopic — try the backlink-safe path first:
   `bash ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/obsidian-rename.sh --target <vault> --from <old-rel.md> --to <new-rel.md>`.
   On exit 3 (`[skip] cli-rename: …`), fall back to `git mv`. Exit 0 means
   Obsidian also updated any path-form backlinks; title-form `[[wikilinks]]`
   are unaffected by moves in either branch.
3. Update each moved page's `parent:` and `path:` (both branches — Obsidian
   does not know our frontmatter schema).
4. Update the parent folder note: remove moved children from `children:`, add subfolder entries to `child_indexes:` (quoted `"[[wikilink]]"` entries).
5. Update `wiki/index.md` to reflect new locations.
6. Add obvious `related:` cross-links (pages sharing 2+ sources, pages in the same new subtopic, pages referenced in body text).

### 3.4 One re-run of lint-fix

Invoke the `Task` tool with `subagent_type: claude-wiki-pages-curator-agent` and the
following prompt verbatim:

```
Run a post-restructure lint and fix pass. Pages were moved and new
folder notes were created. Verify parent/path, children arrays, and
index entries are consistent. This is the final pass.
```

Do not spawn a third run. Unresolved errors go into the final report.

### 3.5 Log

Append to `wiki/log.md`:

```
## [YYYY-MM-DD] optimize | Tree restructure
Moved N pages into subtopic folders. Created N new folder notes.
Current tree: <summary>.
```

## Final report template
